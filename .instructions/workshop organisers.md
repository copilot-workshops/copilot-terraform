# Workshop Organisers

You can reuse this content to deliver your own GitHub Copilot workshops for your colleagues, partners or customers. This page contains information to help you deliver this as a workshop.


Duration | Activity | Notes
--- | --- | ---
15 mins | Copilot presentation | Deliver a presentation on the benefits of Copilot and how it works
30 mins | Open Q&A | In delivering many workshops to date, we've found attendees always have many questions about Copilot including how it works, what languages are supported, how it can be used in their day-to-day work, etc. We recommend you allow time for this. Make sure you're familiar with the [differences](https://github.com/features/copilot#pricing) between Copilot for Business and Copilot for Individuals. You should also review and familiarise yourself with the Copilot FAQ section at the bottom of [this page](https://github.com/features/copilot).
60 mins | Workshop | 15 minute instructor walkthrough of [core exercise](<./2. core exercises.md>), followed by 45 minutes for the [challenge exercises](<./3. challenge exercises.md>). You may even have time to allow some of the participants to share how they solved the challenge exercises.
15 mins | A look at Copilot X | Finish off the workshop by demonstrating [Copilot X](https://gh.io/copilotx) - GitHub's vision for the future of Copilot. This is a great way to end the workshop and leave attendees excited about the future of Copilot.

#### Post event survey
You should also provide a short survey at the end of the workshop to help assess the impact of the workshop and allow you to iterate and learn for future workshop deliveries. If you wish, you could copy and edit this [sample survey](https://forms.gle/gq95Y18S4K7M9Jst8) using Google Forms.
