## Workshop exercises

### Core exercise

The following exercises will help you get started with GitHub Copilot. You must have completed the [setup instructions](<./1. setup.md>) before starting these steps.


<details>
<summary>1a. Defining resources in a Terraform file</summary>

### Step by step instructions


:bulb:  When you see the :leftwards_arrow_with_hook: symbol, you need to press the ENTER key.


1. After completing the steps detailed in [1. setup.md](<./1. setup.md>), you should have either VScode (or a supported IDE) open **OR** a GitHub Codespace open in your browser. If you have neither, please complete the steps in [1. setup.md](<./1. setup.md>) before continuing.

2. Ensure you can see the files in the **Explorer view**. If not, click the **Explorer View icon** on the left sidebar of your editor.

3. Double click on the `variables.tf` file in the Explorer view. This file defines the inputs required to deploy an Azure VM. We won't be editing this file. 
> :bulb: Simply by having this file open in a tab, it will provide additional context to GitHub Copilot to enhance the suggestions Copilot will present.

4. Double click on the `main.tf` file in the Explorer view. This is the Terraform script we are going to edit. We've already defined some resources like a resource group and a virtual network. We're going to add a few additional resources with the help of GitHub Copilot such as a security group and finally a virtual machine.

5. Let's add a Security Group resource to our Terraform file. Navigate to the end of the main.tf file and add the following comment.

```// Security Group```  :leftwards_arrow_with_hook:

6. Copilot should now suggest the code block to use for a Security Group. Once it appears, press **TAB** then **ENTER** to accept the suggestion.
> :bulb: Remember: GitHub Copilot is a pair programmer. It is the human's responsibility to review the suggestions and accept the ones that make sense.

7. Next, let's associate our new security group with the existing network interfaces defined earlier in the Terraform file. At the end of the `main.tf` file, add the following comment.

```// Main network interface security group association```  :leftwards_arrow_with_hook:

8. Copilot should now suggest the code block to use to assocaite the new security group with the existing network interfaces. Once it appears, press **TAB** then **ENTER** to accept the suggestion.

9. Finally, let's define an Azure VM resource. At the end of the `main.tf` file, add the following comment.

```// Virtual Machine```   :leftwards_arrow_with_hook:

10. Copilot should now suggest the code block to use to create a Virtual Machine. Once it appears, press **TAB** then **ENTER** to accept the suggestion. Notice how the suggested code block references resources defined previously.



You're now ready to start the [challenge exercises](<./3. challenge exercises.md>) to see how you can leverage the power of GitHub Copilot to solve a number of challenges yourself.
