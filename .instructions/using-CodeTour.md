## What is CodeTour?

[CodeTour](https://github.com/microsoft/codetour) is a VS Code extension that allows you to create guided tours of your codebases. It’s a great way to onboard new developers to your project, or to help developers learn how to use a new feature. We're going to use CodeTour to display the steps you want to follow in these hands on  exercises. If you don't want to use CodeTour, you can follow the instructions in the README.md file.

## How to use the guided CodeTour

1. For our exercises, you'll get started by navigating to the appropriate repo and choosing '**Use this template**', and '**Open in a codespace**'

### Wrap up

Hopefully you've seen how easy it is for GitHub Copilot to help you build out your Terraform files! Remember, GitHub Copilot is probabalistic so you may not get the exact same code suggestions as we did.
