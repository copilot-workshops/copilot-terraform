## FAQ 

- **How do I get a GitHub Copilot license?**
  - You can request a trial license from your GitHub Sales representative or via Copilot for Individuals or Business licenses.
- **How do I get a GitHub Codespaces license?**
    - Codespaces is included with GitHub Enterprise Cloud, GitHub Enterprise Server, and GitHub Free. You can check under your [billing settings page](https://github.com/settings/billing).
- **I am having trouble activating GitHub Copilot after I load the plugin, what should I do?**
    - This could be because you launched your Codespace before you activated GitHub Copilot or accepted the invitation to the trial org. Please try to reload your Codespace and try again.
