Estimated time to complete: `<10 minutes`

## Description
This is a self-guided tutorial to help folks learn how to use GitHub Copilot. In this project you will find:

* an instructions folder containing the CodeTour and non-CodeTour guides for this exercise 

## To complete this tutorial, you will need:
* Access to [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
